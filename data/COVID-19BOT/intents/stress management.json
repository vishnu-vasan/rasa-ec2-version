            "1. Research volunteering opportunities in your city and mark down the most interesting ones. When the quarantines and isolation ends, we’ll still be in a pretty precarious situation. Making a personal contribution is the best way to show the world you care.\n2. Keep a quarantine diary: it will be \"fun\" to read it again in a few years.\n3. If you have a creative hobby like photography, painting, sculpture, writing, or graphic design, consider entering a competition.\n4. Study. It’s now possible to take thousands of top-level courses online, completely free.\n5. Help the poor and needy people in your locality.\n6. Learn new languages which would be really helpful ."
